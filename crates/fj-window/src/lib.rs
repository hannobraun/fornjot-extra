//! This library is part of the [Fornjot] ecosystem. Fornjot is an open-source,
//! code-first CAD application; and collection of libraries that make up the CAD
//! application, but can be used independently.

//! This library is an internal component of Fornjot. It is not relevant to end
//! users that just want to create CAD models.
//!
