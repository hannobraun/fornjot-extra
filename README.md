# Fornjot - Extra Components

## About

These are extra components from the [Fornjot repository](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot), that are no longer actively maintained.

Fornjot's goal was to create a next-generation, code-first CAD application. This goal has changed (see [A New Direction](https://www.fornjot.app/blog/a-new-direction/)), and these components no longer fit the new scope.

If you want to fix an issue, or update these components to use the latest version of Fornjot proper, your pull request is always welcome! However, more ambitious work, like substantial feature additions or other larger changes, are more suited for a new project. Feel free to fork at will!
